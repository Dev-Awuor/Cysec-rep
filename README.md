## The Journey Vibe  
This repo isn’t a static tutorial—it’s my personal adventure log. You’ll feel the bumps when I fumbled `chmod`, the thrill when I nailed a buffer-overflow, and the aha-moments customizing my first nmap scan. Think of it like a ride through the world of learning security practices: fast, a bit unpredictable, but always heading towards mastery.

## What You’ll Experience  
1. **CTF Write-ups**  
   Short narratives with clear objectives, command-line snippets (`ssh`, `grep`, `nc`) and final flags. Perfect for recruiters glancing at command proficiency.  
2. **Hackathon Highlights**  
   Team-based projects that blend front-end dashboards with backend threat analysis. See how I coordinate with designers, manage Git workflows and deploy prototypes under pressure.  
3. **Tooling & Automation**  
   Reusable Bash/Python scripts for port scanning, log parsing and automated reconnaissance. Shows my ability to streamline red-team workflows and boost productivity.  
4. **Guides & Notes**  
   Personal tutorials on Linux navigation, SSH key management, tmux/screen sessions and quick-start pentesting checklists. Great for tracing my thought process from basics to advanced tactics.
